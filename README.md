# First-Year-Symposium
A repository for everything regarding our first year symposium project.


Objective:

Rough Draft of C++ Code (20% of project grade)
Due: Sunday, November 7th by 11:59pm to Blackboard (one submission per group)
Your rough draft should include, at a minimum, all of the following required project elements:
  A well-designed introduction/splash screen ← Should include the name of your game!
  Decision structures (ie, if statements) to determine game flow and a menu that uses a switch statement
  At least one while, one do-while, and one for loop
  At least one value-returning function and one void function
  Validation of ALL user input
  Well-formatted code, with proper indentation, meaningful variable names, and an organized user interface
  Documentation /* comments! */ throughout according to COSC 1435 guidelines
  Basically, you need to meet all of the minimum requirements of the project outlined in the project description above except working with files, 
  including arrays/vectors, and the surprise twist! Your draft needs to actually compile and run on riddler in order to be graded.

Our game’s primary goal is to emphasize the importance of time management for first-year students. 
The game is called “Escape or Be Eaten” and is centered around many different choices that the player has to make under a time limit. 
The main character has been kidnapped by cannibals and has to escape before they are turned into their kidnappers' dinner. 

The game takes place on an island paradise turned prison where the main character wakes up from what was supposed to be another day of fun in the sun, 
in the cannibal's clutches. 
With very limited resources and under heavy time constraints, the player must outwit the cannibals and get back to civilization.
They wonder, “is anyone even looking for me  yet,” “how long has it been?” 
The first obstacle they face is getting back their shoes, phone, and their wallet. 
Our player can only hope they can navigate the complex they are being held in to find their things, and the way out before their escape is realized. 
During this journey to survive, the player faces feelings of isolation, fear, and anxiety. Similar to how a freshman might feel on a new campus.
But the player will then come to find out that there is always a solution. It just takes effort and strategy and you’ll find your way. 

We want the players to feel the importance of each decision, and recognize that the decisions you make early on can have an impact on your future. 
One of the first decisions the player faces in the game is whether or not to look for their shoes. 
When someone is kidnapped, their shoes give them an advantage, something we often take for granted.
They could save a kidnapped person’s life if they need to run from cannibals, perhaps through the jungle where the ground is littered with pointy bits of nature. 
A seemingly unimportant thing in the face of danger suddenly becomes a tipping point. 
This is an exaggerated example but first year students face decisions like this every day! 
Is planning out a meeting with your group really so important when the due date is weeks away? 
They’ll find out the answer to this when no one is available at the same time the week before the due date and their first runthrough of their presentation is 
in class in front of all their peers… 
They probably should have thought ahead.

Many first year students have issues with managing time so the high stakes and fast paced atmosphere of our game will be a fun training tool to help students 
start making important decisions quickly and efficiently. 
The audience for our project is going to be all the students at the first year symposium and Dr. Rita.
